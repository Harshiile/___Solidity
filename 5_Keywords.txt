1. virtual : It allows functions/modifier in base contract to be overridden by derived contract


2. abstract : The abstract contract meant for inheritance, we can't use this contract stand alone


3. override : That indicate that current contract is overriding virtual function/modifier of base contract


4. super : Instance of parent contract (use to invoke base contract functions/properties)


5. pure : It indicates that function operates just based on input parameters & do not access/alter the blockchain state(like variables,balance etc...)


6. immutable : It uses for state variable which assign onces, so we can't modifiy the values
             : Can't use with string,struct...
             : Also, this uses lower gas than state varibale without immutable
